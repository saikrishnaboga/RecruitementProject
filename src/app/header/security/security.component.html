<p class="matter">
The ongoing advancement of technology is unfortunately accompanied by the ongoing advancement of cyber threats. From the Internet of Things to hyper-connected systems and intranets, for those charged with the integrity of technical infrastructure, risks are seemingly everywhere. With the help of technologies like robotic process automation (RPA), modern business leaders have more options than ever before to ensure cybersecurity.

<h1 class="heading">Reducing Human Error with Cybersecurity Automation</h1> 
<hr class="h-line">   
<p class="matter">By implementing RPA for cybersecurity and other intelligent automation initiatives, you help eliminate human error, which happens to be one of the biggest culprits in cybersecurity challenges. This might involve a simple solution, like programming a bot to prompt password updates every 90 days to prevent weak credentials. Or, it might be a highly technical solution, like automating select segments of a server reconfiguration process. Either way, with automation doing the bulk of the work, IT and cybersecurity can focus on higher value work.</p>
